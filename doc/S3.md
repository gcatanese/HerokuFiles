# Amazon S3

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) in the remote storage offered by Amazon. It is not entirely free but extremely cheap, 
for very low usage it won't even charge.
Using Python [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) it is pretty simple to
access and manage any file type.   
A great plus of this option is that there are several other S3 compatible storage services, which makes easier
to move to a different provider if needed. 

Notes:
* create AWS credentials from [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/home) 

**Get a file**
```
session = boto3.session.Session()

s3 = session.client(
    service_name='s3',
    aws_access_key_id='xyz',
    aws_secret_access_key='abc'
)

s3.download_file(Bucket='bucket_name', Key='dir/a.txt', Filename=/tmp/a.txt)
```

**Put a file**
```
session = boto3.session.Session()

s3 = session.client(
    service_name='s3',
    aws_access_key_id='xyz',
    aws_secret_access_key='abc'
)

s3.upload_file(Bucket='bucket_name', Key='dir/a.txt', Filename=/tmp/a.txt)
```


**Example**

Checkout [sample code](https://github.com/gcatanese/HerokuFiles/tree/main/app/s3_api.py) in s3_api.py

## Deploy to Heroku

Before deploying to Heroku make sure to define the AWS credentials as environment variables and create the corresponding Heroku Config Vars
```
heroku config:set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xyz)
heroku config:set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=abc)
```
